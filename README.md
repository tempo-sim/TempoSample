# TempoSample
A sample Unreal project intended to be a reference for recommended settings, convenient scripts, code examples, and project organization when using the [Tempo](https://github.com/tempo-sim/Tempo) plugins.

If you are starting an Unreal project from scratch with Tempo, you can use this as a [template](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-repository-from-a-template) repo and rename the project with `Scripts/Rename.sh`.
